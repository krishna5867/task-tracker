# Task Tracker Application

This is a simple and intuitive To-Do List web application built with React.js for functionality and Tailwind CSS for styling.

- Mark Tasks as Completed: Use a checkbox to toggle the completion status of a task.
- Delete Tasks: Remove individual tasks from the list.

- Filter Tasks: View tasks by their status: All, Completed, or Pending.
- Alert for Empty Tasks: Displays an alert if the user tries to add a blank task.
